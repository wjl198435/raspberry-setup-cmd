Faster OpenCV for Raspberry Pi

Leverage all your CPUs power in OpenCV by using TBB, Neon and VFPV3 libraries.

Since I've already compiled this on my own Raspberry Pi I made it available on GitHub.

Save countless of compile time by just installing these debs. Enjoy!

What is this?

A pre-compiled OpenCV 4.1.0 for Raspberry Pi optimized for deep learning / computer vision applications (NEON, VFPV3, TBB turned on).
Bindings for Python 2 and Python 3 are also included.
For detailed build informations click here.
Created with OpenCV cpack targets.
Tested on Raspberry Pi 3 using Raspbian Buster (Debian 10) (for Raspbian Stretch click here).
How much faster?

Performance tests have been made in this great blog article which led to an approximate 30% increase in speed and of over 48% when applied strictly to DNN module.

Another performance test is available here which also led to about 30% increase in speed.

How to use it?

Install OpenCV library prerequisites on your Raspberry Pi.

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y
	libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libgtk-3-dev \
	libavcodec-extra libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev \
	libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libjasper1 libjasper-dev \
	libatlas-base-dev gfortran libeigen3-dev libtbb-dev
Install numpy based on your target Python version:

sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev python3-numpy
or:

sudo apt-get install -y python-dev python-numpy
How to install?

Clone the repo into your Raspberry Pi and install all debs:

git clone https://github.com/dlime/Faster_OpenCV_4_Raspberry_Pi.git
cd Faster_OpenCV_4_Raspberry_Pi/debs
sudo dpkg -i OpenCV*.deb
sudo ldconfig
How to test?

C++

Test the installation by going to tests cpp test folder, build it and launch the executable:

cd Faster_OpenCV_4_Raspberry_Pi/tests/cpp_opencv_test
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j`cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep -c 'processor'`
./cpp_opencv_test
Python

Test the installation by going to tests folder and launch the test.py file:

cd Faster_OpenCV_4_Raspberry_Pi/tests/python_opencv_test
python test.py
You shouldn't see any error messages in console and an image with tetris blocks with contours drawed should appear.

How to uninstall?

Run the following command in your Raspberry Pi terminal:

sudo apt purge opencv-*
